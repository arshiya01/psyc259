Um, just 'cause he taught me so many valuable lessons. Like I guess referring back to the past is kind of about empathy. Like I don't really think I tend to be a very empathetic person, which like, I feel like I, I realize and am very aware of. But like my dad no, he, he literally no matter who the person is like will treat them with the equal amount of respect. It doesn't like matter like, I guess I think part of it honestly came from like he was in the air force and you're saying ROTC, like I think like probably being in that and like having that hierarchy, like probably showed him that like maybe he's not super fond of like the hierarchy and how that all works. Um, so I, I think he, he really recognizes that like, all right, you do have to be empathetic and like you have to show respect to everyone. I mean 'cause you simply don't know what's going on in their life, which is, I'm very appreciative that, like I've seen that firsthand from my dad, even though I might not pick up on it as much as I probably should. And then the other thing I'm really grateful for is like baseball, which has provided me with so many opportunities. Like, it's part of the reason I got into Princeton. It's literally like my most love thing in life. I just enjoy it so much. It brings lots of happiness to me. It's provided me, um, like it's allowed me to travel the country, live in different places. It's literally been like the motivation behind pretty much what I do, um, with my life.

Uh, my dad was also in the military. Uh, he's in the Navy, he's a pilot. Uh, so definitely incredible role model there. And then my mom is, uh, just like an incredibly, uh, humble person, uh, and just like gives everything for, for us. Uh, so yeah, it's hard not to be grateful for that. Um, let's see, I'm also very grateful for, uh, getting into Princeton, but also, uh, I started dating my girlfriend in high school and then she also got into Princeton a year after me.

Like this guy, I, I think the reason I admire him so much it's because like when no one else had confidence in me, like this guy did with, with, with like baseball stuff. Like he always told me like, ""Alright, like you're gonna go big places with baseball,"" and no matter how bad, how good, like I was playing. He like literally never lost confidence in my abilities. And that's something like, and he was very vocal about it. Like he made sure that like I was, like he was confident in making sure I was confident myself. And then also he just like, excuse my language. But he's just like, doesn't give a fuck about the world. Like, like he just lifts his own life. Like, I, I, I think there's something like to admire in that by itself. Like he literally just like, does what, like granted empathy, empathy like doesn't really go along with this, but like he literally lives his life. And like, if someone tells him something's bad for him, he's like, ""It doesn't matter. Like I want to do this."" He does what he wants to do. Like, I don't know.

And at some point you just gotta, you just gotta go for it. Um, so, who do I admire most? I definitely admire my, uh, my freshman year Bible study leader. He was a senior. Um, and he was just like this incredibly, uh, devout guy and, uh, really down to earth. And, uh, yeah, so he was, he was a great Bible study leader, but then afterwards he, he went to go teach for a year and now he is studying philosophy at Oxford.

And so one person has their side and they're not willing to change their mind, the other person has their side and so like you're just in the middle and you kind of have to help them see each other's side.

I just stay down the forever. Like, that sounds super depressing.

But I think another thing is just that, like, um, I know a lot of people that I know who like are on the same shoes as I am, have also found consulting offers, which is great. I'm really happy for them, but it's like, what am I doing wrong that like they have, you know, so I think that like recently I've been really focused on, um, trying to, uh, determine my own self worth and trying to figure out like how that like, um, is amended with like my goals for the future. You know, I don't know if that makes sense.",1018,['laugh'],control,0.912545438,-0.052294006,0.156842218
Speaker 1,13:31,"That does make sense. And you've definitely given me a lot of information. Um, so I'm gonna like, like answer or, or give my best advice, like peace wise, I suppose. So, um, I will say that I completely empathize with what you were saying about, um, about, you know, coding. And I feel like partly it's because of like my own interest and that I'm not too interested in coding, but I think that I'm not other is just the fact that at Princeton, all my coding classes are just like a hundred miles an hour. So I don't really have time to feel satisfied at anything. And like most of my solutions are like kind of rough and ready and it's like, I don't really, yeah, it's a bit, it's a bit tough. So I don't get satisfaction too much from that. I will say though, like, so, um, one thing that I've, so I think for the longest time as an electrical engineering student, I thought to myself that, you know, the, the best path to take is, um, programming, software engineering, but then after doing an internship and software engineering, I realized that I don't really gain any satisfaction from like continuously coding. And yeah, I've had the exact same thoughts as you like, will this be my whole life? And so I've like you I've, um, ventured into like different fields and started exploring different things. So like product management, uh, consulting, venture capital, stuff like that. And I think that we're in a great position as people who can, who can get internships and like who can like apply for like this stuff to like, see what we like, see, see what we enjoy. Um, so I would definitely recommend you like keep going down the path of like, finding out what you enjoy and just like trying out different things, cause that is the best way to figure out what you wanna do for your career like once you graduate and stuff and that's, you know, I mean, Princeton will give you the mindset that like you have to like, know what, you know, know what you wanna do, get the internships in the exact place you wanna be, but that's not the case. What the real case is is that your internships help you find out what exactly you want. And I going on to the question of like, I guess, self worth and stuff, I, I know that I was something I've also struggled with, um, you know, seeing my peers achieve and me not achieving. Um, and I, I don't have one thing I will say is that of course, like the whole notion of going to prince and it will, it will do its best to try and kill yourself worth. And so I think what's great is to have like good friends around you who continue because, um, you know, at least for me reassurement is good to an extent, but then you also wanna like, make things happen so I suppose, like having a friend, you can, I guess, you know, practice with work with, um, you know, if you, if, uh, if I an interview you feel like you've done, you've done what, but you haven't like done the best that you can to get in. Then maybe just reaching out to people, networking and just seeing how you can get more, more of that practice, um, is what I guess, you know, um, yeah, practice usually helps me improve my self worth and stuff like that. And it helps me gain regain confidence in what I'm in regain confidence in my pursuits, I suppose. So that's, that's a, that's the best advice I can give to you from someone who's felt a lot of the same emotions you felt.",1018,[],control,0.9311413,-0.030576124,0.192013319

Because the like, for, as far as my own life, my, my brother's now into boarding school, so we weren't... we were really close as kids and then, we, all of a sudden, just got separated, so being, you know, physically apart kind of distanced ourselves from each other.

Not to like divert to me, but like, I guess like how I was able to kind of handle this kind of situation was, I felt really guilty about not spending time with my little sisters who are at home right now. So I, I would push that back. I would actually schedule time and then like you said, like, there's no deadline for really spending time with them. So it would just get pushed back further and further. And then sometimes, you know, I would go to bed feeling really guilty, not having like spent time with them, like interacted with them and everything. Um, but then what I started doing, 'cause at least like right before I went to bed, um, hopefully by then I've done as much as I want to, like throughout the day, you know? Um, I would just talk to them, you know, just like sit down and I guess that would be similar to like having a call, you know, like at the very end of the day, just talking to them even just like 10 minutes. And I saw that like over the past few days, my relationship with them was like able to get a lot better. Um, like what I had neglect, what I had neglected for months, you know doing, I had like pushed back for months and months, just spending time with them. I started doing literally like five to 10 minutes, um, at the end of the day. And then like, I don't know, my relationship with them has been getting better.

Right? 'Cause like, I guess my sisters would be a very different level from like meeting people, um, over Zoom. But yeah, I guess I'm mean, I would say your CPS counselor has some good advice, right? Like setting aside just a little of time, but um, at the same time, if talking to them is more draining, you know, more so, or like it does seem like this responsibility that you have to do that you're not particularly enjoying, then I don't think you have to pursue it.

I, my, my mother's diagnosed with, um... I don't remember what she calls it, but it's this condition of empathy where she really, really feels strongly what others are feeling and it can make her life very hard.

Um, but I, I didn't think you could actually change the amount of empathy you had, because I think for me it's been separate from understanding how other people feel.

It's just like, I think you just develop new thought patterns.

Um, and a lot of the experiences that I have had and, and where I ended up, and how I got there, like, the journey I guess you could say, um, is because of how I was raised and what I had. Um, I would say, obviously, I wish we were more financially stable, um, for my own benefit, but also for my sibling's benefit, I think they would be in different positions in life, if they had the financial security that I have now growing, like, as a teenager.

But um, I grew up with my parents, like, never being married, and my dad living 3000 miles away, um, and so obviously it was, like, hard not having, like, both parents to go to a soccer game, or to, like, lean on them when I both needed it, and they didn't really have an amicable friendship or relationship. So, um, I would say, like, having less conflict between my two parents, and like, living even closer together and getting to spend more time with my dad would be great. Um, but kinda, like, what you mentioned, like, it's made me who I am today, and like, I appreciate, like, the face time so much more, um, just 'cause, like, that's what I'm used to, and it also, like, has made me stronger.

Um, it's pretty much all on you, um, and I'm home too, so I don't really see other students, my siblings are out of college and they're just, like, working.

Speaker 1,8:55,"Okay. Um, and I guess for me, I guess I did have a similar problem... Um, I guess also a personal problem that I'm currently having too would probably be managing, like, academic life with life, um, in general. That was, like, one of my goals for this semester, um, when I look back over winter break on my fall semester, I realized, like, I didn't have a life, and that made me really, really sad, considering, like, I'm still young, and I'm in college. Um, so I think this semester, a goal of mine has to been to spend more time with family, not spend so much time locked up in my room doing work. Um, if I can go out and do something with, um, a friend, or a cousin or something like that, I'll say yes instead of saying no. And that isn't to say prioritizing academics is, like, not happening, but that I'm prioritizing myself too. Um, but it's been kinda hard because it's snowing and it's cold, um, and there's a lot of work with the semester just starting.

Speaker 2,10:15,"For sure. Um, definitely something I've also, like, struggled with from the beginning of quarantine until, like, the second semester. Um, and I say, like, first, like, acknowledging that you need to have a healthy balance is the most important thing, because I know, like, as Princeton students, it's really easy to just, like, get into the routine of working all the time. Um, so I've been incorporating, like, more, like, self-care into my daily routine, like, not doing homework at night, and, like, taking that time to cook a really good meal with my family or, like, FaceTime an old friend. Um, and just, like, yeah, kinda like, realizing my priorities, but also, like, making sure that I'm taking care of my mental health, because when I'm not, then, like, my schoolwork isn't gonna really work either. Um, so I'd say, like, allotting time every day, as much as you want to just, like, go outside for a walk when it's not snowing. Or, like, bake with a family member, or, um, do something safe with friends outside. Just, like, scheduling it into your day, just like you would schedule your time to do work. Um, and then also, like, it's a really accentuating circumstances, so like, keep, your teachers know that too. I have to remind myself that, like, they're also having a hard time.

Speaker 1,11:36,"Hmm, longterm goal. Um, I guess kind of building upon the last thing I said about having a life, um, I'm considering, like, medical school, um, considering, very lightly use that word, um, 'cause I'm not 100% sure, but I think something that comes with that, um, is constant work, um, and always being busy with that. So I guess a longtime goal would be if I do decide to pursue that path, going and getting into medical school. Um, but also with that, um, hopefully by then I'll have figured out how to balance, um, my social life and self-care with academic priorities as well. I think it's very important.

Because I feel like in the bubble of Princeton, like, I'm kind of feeling pressured to go into a certain industry, or find a, like, competitive internship, just 'cause lots of people around me are doing. Um, and while, like, I do wanna push myself, and, like, take advantage of Princeton resources, and like, ultimately do well, I still wanna, like, stay true to what I really am passionate about, um, and like, philanthropy's okay.

Um, I think a lot of people, at least stereotypically, um, view high school as, like, this awful place where there's a lot of people who are cliquey and different. Um, and then I went to, like, an all girls school in the middle of nowhere in Connecticut, and it was a boarding school, so I was kind of stuck with, like, 200 girls for four years.

And unfortunately, even though, like, I have sisters, like, um, and they're fully willing to, like, I guess, work and stuff, there's, like, this kind of gender-based pressure, I think. Uh, like, an unspoken kinda gender-based pressure in my household as, like, the only son. Um, but you know, I probably wanna do a job that, like, pays well. Um, and so I think coming into college, I was like, ""Oh, yeah. Of course, I'm just gonna graduate from here and, like, start working immediately."" Um, and I think it was just spending time in college to really kind of continuously think about what it is that I want to do. Um, what it is that I enjoy, what it is that is gonna be meaningful and still be, like, something that doesn't put an economic burden on my parents. Um, I think tho- those are like a lot of things to try and balance. Um, especially when, to the point that you were saying earlier, you haven't actually had a chance to, like, go out in all these fields and figure it out. Like, you're basically just working with whatever information is available to you, um, and trying to make the best decision from that. So I think that's... it was really a process of that. But I think once I was able to admit to myself that I don't actually want to be working as, like, an engineer, and a- as much as, like, I might not be bad at it and might enjoy some parts of it, I enjoy, you know, a lot more parts of this thing that I'm choosing to do now. And, um, like, uh, it just seems a lot more exciting to me, it's something I'd want to be doing for a longer term. And so I think once, like, I think to that end, I was like, ""Well, you know, if a PhD is gonna help me get there, then so be it."" Um, like, I'll spend- I'll spend those years in school.
